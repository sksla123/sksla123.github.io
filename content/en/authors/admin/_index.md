I am currently an undergraduate student in the Department of IT Convergence Engineering at Jeonbuk National University and a research student in the Data Mining Lab.



I am studying LLM models like BERT and GPT, exploring the latest technologies in natural language processing and information retrieval. My research focuses on understanding how language models analyze data and extract useful information, while gaining practical experience by applying these concepts in real-world projects.
