      title: üìö My study direction
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am very interested in the field of natural language processing and information retrieval.
        


        Currently, I am focused on tasks that compare multiple sentences using models like BERT, and I am also exploring how to apply this to product search. I am looking into applying and utilizing various models for Sparse Retrieval and Dense Retrieval.
