Inspired by the popular drama Squid Game, I created a tug-of-war game.

**Project Development Background**



Initially, the project I envisioned was a character development game based on MBTI. The core of this game was to have various events occur, but I realized that implementing these events effectively would pose challenges during development. After discussions with my team members, we decided to change the theme.



As a result, we came up with the idea of mini-games inspired by Squid Game. However, considering the skill levels of the team members, we realized that creating multiple mini-games would be too ambitious. After further discussions, we ultimately decided to focus on developing a tug-of-war game based on the tug-of-war scene from Squid Game.



**Description**


Users can choose either Single Mode or Multi Mode at the start of the game.

The gameplay involves pulling the rope by pressing the spacebar.

The team that pulls the rope more than the opposing team wins.

During the game, the fever gauge and lives fluctuate and are displayed in real-time based on the game progress.




**Difficulties**


Providing animations and multiplayer functionality was really challenging. It required a lot of time and effort to combine and optimize various elements. Despite the difficulties, I believe I learned a great deal and grew during this process.
