Participation in the TREC 2024 Product Search Track

<!--more-->

**TREC**



TREC is one of the leading international conferences focused on various tracks related to information retrieval.



**Product Search Track**



It primarily focuses on tasks that find the most relevant products based on user queries using Amazon's product data.



**Submissions**



We conducted experiments using a two-tower model that simultaneously performs Sparse Retrieval and Dense Retrieval.



**Features**



We strengthened the relationships between product data through product document summarization and conducted experiments with the Two-Tower model using the trained language model. For Sparse Retrieval, we aim to enhance performance by using GeLU instead of the conventional ReLU function for token activation.
